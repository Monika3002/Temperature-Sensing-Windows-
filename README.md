# Temperature-Sensing-Windows-
This arduino based Temperature sensing automatic window controller project controls window open angle according to the room temperature and humidity. Show these parameter changes on the serial monitor.
[]![Circuit Diagram]()

-> Libraries used in this project are servo.h and dht.h .
-> DHT sensor is used to sense the temperature and humitdity in the environment.
-> It may also be used for monitoring changes in environment.
-> In near future, it can also be used in different industries and electronic devices.
-> Nowadays Arduino becomes more popular because of its many advantages like simple programming and compact in size and it supports many device.
